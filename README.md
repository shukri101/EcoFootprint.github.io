Carbon Footprint Calculator
This calculator helps you estimate the carbon footprint of a borehole drilling project. Simply enter the distance travelled to the borehole, the fuel consumed by the rig, the weight of the equipment, and the length of the casing. The calculator will then provide an estimate of the total carbon footprint in kilograms of CO2 and the number of trees needed to offset the carbon footprint.

Getting Started
To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in a web browser and enter the required information. The carbon footprint and number of trees needed to offset the carbon footprint will be automatically calculated and displayed.
